# WordscapesCheater
A program that helps you cheat at the Scrabble-like mobile app, Wordscapes.

You will be able to enter in the set of characters that Wordscapes gives you, and the program would return matching words based on the characters you provided. There will be several options.

One option would simply return all valid words of all lengths (all matching words, between 3 and 7 letters long)

Another option would only return matching words of a given length.

And the final option will be that you enter in the location of letters you have already found, (i.e. ST_C_) and it would then return any matching words.
